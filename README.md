# jaroop-bank

Steps to use:
- Copy this project or download it to your desktop or wherever you want to access it
- Download and install Java (I installed the newest version) and then follow the directions
- Download and install JSoup if you don't have it

- After those installations are complete, you must compile and run the program. In order to do so with JSoup without an IDE
you must run:
java -cp "/Your/File/Path/To/jaroop_assessment/jsoup-1.11.2 .jar:." Bank

  - the easiest way is to copy the file path to the jsoup jar file, it should look like
         <java -cp "filepath:." Bank>

# NOTES
It currently only superficially desposits and withdraws.
Balance will show you the values for the tables, but will not sum them.
